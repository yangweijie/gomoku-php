# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for porting the Ruby Go game to a PHP-based Five-in-a-Row (Gomoku) game using the yangweijie/kingbes-libui-sdk. The application will provide a cross-platform desktop GUI for playing Gomoku with customizable game settings, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux through the LibUI framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to start a new Gomoku game with customizable board settings, so that I can play with different game configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main game window with a default 15x15 Gomoku board
2. WHEN I select "New Game" from the menu THEN the system SHALL display a configuration dialog with board size options (9x9 to 19x19)
3. WHEN I configure game settings THEN the system SHALL allow me to set board dimensions and first player selection
4. WHEN I confirm new game settings THEN the system SHALL create a new game board with the specified configuration
5. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL indicate which player goes first (traditionally black stones)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to place stones on the board by clicking, so that I can make my moves in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's my turn THEN the system SHALL highlight the current player (black or white stones)
2. WHEN I click on an empty intersection THEN the system SHALL place my stone at that position
3. WHEN I click on an occupied intersection THEN the system SHALL ignore the click and provide visual feedback
4. WHEN I place a stone THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to the other player's turn
5. WHEN I place a stone THEN the system SHALL update the visual board immediately
6. WHEN I hover over valid positions THEN the system SHALL show a preview of where my stone would be placed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to automatically detect when someone wins, so that the game can conclude properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player gets 5 stones in a row horizontally THEN the system SHALL declare that player as the winner
2. WHEN a player gets 5 stones in a row vertically THEN the system SHALL declare that player as the winner
3. WHEN a player gets 5 stones in a row diagonally THEN the system SHALL declare that player as the winner
4. WHEN a win condition is met THEN the system SHALL display a game over dialog showing the winner
5. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL prevent further stone placement
6. WHEN the board is full with no winner THEN the system SHALL declare a draw

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to undo my last move, so that I can correct mistakes during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select "Undo" THEN the system SHALL remove the last placed stone from the board
2. WHEN I undo a move THEN the system SHALL switch back to the previous player's turn
3. WHEN there are no moves to undo THEN the system SHALL disable the undo option
4. WHEN I undo multiple moves THEN the system SHALL maintain proper turn order
5. WHEN the game has ended THEN the system SHALL allow undoing moves to resume play

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to restart the current game, so that I can start over with the same settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select "Restart Game" THEN the system SHALL clear all stones from the board
2. WHEN I restart the game THEN the system SHALL reset to the first player's turn
3. WHEN I restart the game THEN the system SHALL maintain the current board size and settings
4. WHEN I restart during gameplay THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before clearing the board
5. WHEN the game restarts THEN the system SHALL reset any game state indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want the application to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that I can play regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the application on Windows THEN the system SHALL display the game interface using native Windows UI elements
2. WHEN I run the application on macOS THEN the system SHALL display the game interface using native macOS UI elements  
3. WHEN I run the application on Linux THEN the system SHALL display the game interface using native Linux UI elements
4. WHEN I package the application THEN the system SHALL create platform-specific executables for each supported OS
5. WHEN the application runs on any platform THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent gameplay functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual feedback and game status information, so that I can understand the current game state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN the system SHALL display whose turn it is (Black/White player)
2. WHEN I hover over the board THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback for valid move positions
3. WHEN stones are placed THEN the system SHALL render them with distinct colors (black and white)
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update all relevant UI indicators immediately
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display the game title and version information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be easily buildable and distributable, so that it can be packaged for different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the build process THEN the system SHALL create executable files for the target platform
2. WHEN I package the application THEN the system SHALL include all necessary LibUI dependencies
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL produce a standalone executable that doesn't require additional PHP installation
4. WHEN I distribute the application THEN the system SHALL work on target machines without additional setup
5. WHEN building for different platforms THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate LibUI library for each platform
